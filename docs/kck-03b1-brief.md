# KCK-03B1 brief: unified-style concept exploration

**Status: brief for the owner-run generation work (KCK-03B1).** It records decisions
the Owner stated in session on 2026-10-05 so they exist in the repo
([GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md) rule 1). Everything produced under this brief is a
`candidate`. No artwork is added by this PR.

## Question this slice answers

> After Cat, Dinosaur and Robot are redrawn in the shared rendering language, are they
> still recognizably themselves, and do they look like they live in the same world
> (same IP)?

It does not produce production assets, model sheets, animations or 3D. It ends at the
lineup gate (B1-C); the next step needs a new Owner decision.

## Owner decisions recorded here (stated in session)

- Run B1 as **three checkpoints**, not one generation of all three characters
  (image models tend to contaminate characters with each other: a chubby Robot, Cat
  with Dinosaur eyes, Dinosaur with Cat texture).
- The **Dinosaur is the style anchor**: used as the **rendering reference**, not as an
  identity reference. Reason: reads well small, animates easily, clear silhouette,
  converts to 3D easily, lower production cost than the Cat's fur detail, more
  "product" than the pure-crayon Robot.
- The Dinosaur itself is also adjusted a little (see B1-A), so the anchor is a new
  shared style, not the current Dinosaur art unchanged.
- **Unify rendering language, not anatomy.** Do not make everyone big-head/short-limb.

These do not change the approved direction in the
[style bible](character-style-bible.md) ("Soft Handmade 2.5D", Robot proportion
exception). The values below are a starting brief and may be adjusted after B1-A.

## Checkpoints

### B1-A: Dinosaur style key
Input: `dinosaur-01` (rendering and identity).
Goal: soften the digital polish; add a little controlled handmade texture; keep the
current silhouette and proportions; avoid over-glossy, sticker-like finish.
Output: the new shared style anchor (candidate).

### B1-B: Cat and Robot translation (one character per generation)
- **Cat:** inputs = `cat-02` (identity) + B1-A output (rendering reference). Keep Cat
  identity and anatomy; adopt the anchor's rendering system.
- **Robot:** inputs = `robot-01` (identity) + B1-A output (rendering reference).
  **Do not chibify the robot.**

### B1-C: lineup gate
The three side by side. One question for the Owner: *does it look like the same IP?*
Pass → formal turnaround/model sheets can start (a new slice). Fail → iterate B1-A/B.
Pass/fail is the Owner's decision.

## Shared rendering rules (starting brief)

1. **Outline:** all three dark warm brown, similar weight (not Cat light brown, Dinosaur
   dark brown, Robot black).
2. **Coloring:** flat base + one soft shadow + one soft highlight. No multi-layer fur
   gradients, no all-over crayon hatching, no smooth full gradients mixed together.
3. **Texture:** only a very light colored-pencil / paper grain. Texture is seasoning,
   not the rendering method.
4. **Eye system:** same rules, per-character shape: large upper-left highlight, small
   secondary highlight, dark warm pupil, same gloss treatment. Cat may keep an iris,
   Dinosaur large round eyes, Robot black ovals (slightly larger than now, not
   Dinosaur-sized).
5. **Lighting:** from the upper left: soft highlight upper-left, very soft shadow
   lower-right. No ambient scene lighting, no cast shadow.
6. **Edge quality:** clean silhouette with controlled hand-drawn character, not vector
   vs watercolor vs crayon scan.

## Identity locks (what must not change)

| Character | Keep |
|---|---|
| Cat (`cat-02`) | orange tabby, round face, large round eyes, raised paw, pink paw pad, long tail |
| Dinosaur (`dinosaur-01`) | mint body, cream belly with curved lines, soft-yellow back spikes, magnifying glass, peach cheeks |
| Robot (`robot-01`) | rectangular head, long arms and legs, antennae, blue mitten hands and boots, four-shape chest panel, tongue, gray body |

Cat changes (translation): thicker dark-brown outline; fur rendered as shapes, not
strands; tabby stripes as larger color blocks; much less fur texture; simplified volume;
Dinosaur-style highlight treatment; the shared peach/coral cheeks; one soft shadow layer.

Robot changes (translation): keep a slightly imperfect, hand-drawn feel (a little
wobble, not perfectly symmetric) but outline dark brown instead of black, clean base
color plus very light grain instead of dense hatching.

## Pass criteria for the lineup (Owner judges)

- Same-world test: do they look like one illustrator's toys?
- All-black silhouette test: each still identifiable at 64 px.
- Identity test: each still clearly the original character.
- Palette: Cat warm orange, Dinosaur mint, Robot cool gray + blue stay distinct.

## Provenance and status requirements

Per [GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md): every output is a `candidate` until the Owner
approves it, and is not a character master.

For each output, record: the input assets with their SHA-256 (the repo records for
`cat-02`, `dinosaur-01`, `robot-01` already hold these), the generation tool
(and version if known), the full prompt, and the output file's SHA-256. Rights status is
`pending`; derived artwork inherits the unresolved status of its inputs
(`dinosaur-ref-02` origin Unknown; all commercial-use statuses `pending`).

A formal `status` field is added to the provenance schema in the PR that brings the
first concept record into the repo, not before.

Proposed location (to confirm when the first output arrives):
`concepts/kck-03b1/<stage>-<character>-vNN.png` with a matching record, kept outside
`characters/` so a concept is never mistaken for a character master.

## Out of scope

No raster normalization (03B), no animation (03C), no 3D (03D), no turnaround or model
sheets, no changes to `characters/`, the manifest or the five existing records, no
claim that any output is approved.

## Handoff: what to bring back per checkpoint

1. The output image(s).
2. The exact prompt and the tool used.
3. Which input images were attached (cat-02 / dinosaur-01 / robot-01 / B1-A output).
4. Anything rejected and why (kept as `rejected` history if useful).
